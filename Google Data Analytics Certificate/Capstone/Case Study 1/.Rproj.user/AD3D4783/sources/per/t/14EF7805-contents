##Business Task

In this report, I will examine how Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, can maximize the number of annual memberships. To do so, I will answer the following research questions:
*How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
*Why casual riders would buy a membership?
*How digital media could affect their marketing tactics?

To that end, the report will conclude with suggestions for a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. 

This report defines customers who purchase single-ride or fill-day passes as casual riders while customers who purchase annual memebrships are defined as Cyclistic members. 

##Prepare and Process the Data

The data used in this report is the previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data which has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license[link](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). For privacy purposes, no personally identifiable information was used. 

To analyze the data, the following ROCCC framework was used:
***Reliable:** This data is reliable as there is unlikely to be sampling bias given that I am using the data wholesale from Cyclistic.
***Original:** This data is considered original as it is downloaded directly from Cyclistic (first-party data).
***Comprehensive:** The data is comprehensive given that it contains many details for each individual trip.
***Current:** The data is current as it is the previous twelve months of data.
***Cited:** The data is first-hand data.

###Structure
Each month's trip data is downloaded individually as a .csv file. Each file contains 13 columns:
*A ride_id to identify each ride individually
*rideable_type which identifies the type of bike used. There are 3 options: electric_bike, docked_bike, and classic_bike
*start and end date and time: started_at, ended_ at 
*The starting and ending station names and ID - start_nation_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id
*Detailed geographical coordinates of the starting and ending stations: start_lat,start_lng, end_lat, end_lng
*A boolean value detailing if a ride was by a casual rider or a member

##The Process 
After combining the 12 csv files into tibble "ttm", I created 2 columns: ride_length and day_of_week. I then removed all rows where the trip duration was negative and dropped all rows with NULL values. 



I also created 2 separate tibbles filtered for members and casual for easier reference in the analysis process. 


```{r Process and Clean The Data}
ttm <- rbind(nov20, dec20, jan21, feb21, mar21, apr21, may21, jun21, jul21, aug21, sep21, oct21)
rm(nov20, dec20, jan21, feb21, mar21, apr21, may21, jun21, jul21, aug21, sep21, oct21)
ttm<-ttm %>% mutate(year=year(started_at),month=month(started_at), day=day(started_at))
ttm <- mutate(ttm, ride_length=ended_at - started_at)
ttm[['ride_length']] <- hms::hms(seconds_to_period(ttm[['ride_length']]))
ttm <- mutate(ttm,day_of_week=weekdays(started_at))
ttm <- ttm %>% filter(ride_length>"0")
ttm <- mutate(ttm, month= month.abb[month(started_at)])
ttm <- ttm %>% drop_na()
member <- ttm %>% filter(member_casual == "member")
casual <- ttm %>% filter(member_casual == "casual")
```

## Analysis
First, lets examine the statistical distribution of bike rides over the past 12 months, comparing between members and casuals.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
member_stats <- member %>% summarize(mean = mean(ride_length), sd = sd(ride_length), number = nrow(member), max = max(ride_length), min=min(ride_length), member_casual ="member")
casual_stats <- casual %>% summarize(mean = mean(ride_length), sd = sd(ride_length), number = nrow(member),max = max(ride_length), min=min(ride_length), member_casual = "casual")
stats <- rbind(member_stats, casual_stats)
rm(member_stats, casual_stats)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=ttm, aes(x=member_casual,y=ride_length))+
  geom_bar(stat="summary",fun="mean",fill="paleturquoise4")+
  labs(x="Type of Customer", y="Ride Duration (mm:ss)", title = "Average Ride Duration of the Different Types of Customers")+
  annotate("text",x=1,y=1100,label="33:00")+
  annotate("text",x=2,y=500,label="13:28")
```

From the above graph we can see that 


##Change Log
* 21/11/2021
    + Combined all to form a single Data Frame (ttm)
    + Split started_at into year, month and date columns
    + Created a new column called "ride_length" which is the difference between "start_at" and "ended_at"
    + Convert ride_length to <time> data type
    + Created day_of_week using started_at
    + Removed all negative ride_length. Rows decreased from 5,378,834 to 5,376,953
    + Dropped all rows with NULL values. Rows decreased from 5,376,953 to 4,491,323
    + Created casual tibble of dimensions 2,030,607 x 18
    + Created member tibble of dimensions 2,460,716 x 18
    + Created stats tibble of dimensions 2 x 6
